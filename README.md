# Module 11 Note Taker
  

## Description

![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue )

In this project I have developed the backend code for a note taking app that is hosted on Heroku. This was accomplished by making a backend server using node.js and 
express to route fetch requests from the front end code that had been provided for me. This project was a good way to further develop my skills in the backend on 
my way to becoming a fullstack developer. The app also serves the functional purpose of being useful to take notes for class or for errands that need to be done. 



## Installation
